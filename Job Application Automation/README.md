# Automating the job application process

Tired of applying to hundreds of jobs with pretty much the same process manually?
With recruiting websites like SmartRecruiter and Workday, we can (hopefully and maybe accurately) automate these job application processes with 
pre-entered data. Sometimes the resume processor from those websites are kinda crappy :(


## Notes:
- Since my chromedriver is not in the same directory, you can either download your own chromedriver or just clone my entire repository
    - Will make a change to it later

- You can enter your personal data in the Personal_Info_Template.json
    - Those data will be used to fill out the job application

- Change the name of your json file or change the json file name from the python code
    - You can change your json file to myInfo.json as I have that as default in my code

- Have your resume in the same directory
    - Name it Resume.pdf
